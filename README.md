## Minimum Requirements:
1. 💖 **Interest**: Promoters must share a genuine love for the events we create.
2. ⏰ **Availability**: Promoters should be available to promote events on the agreed-upon dates and times. In general, expect to spend anywhere from 1 to 10 hours per week on promotion-related tasks.
3. 🚗 **Transportation**: Access to reliable transportation is essential for reaching promotional locations. Contact a team member or manager to coordinate transportation and give us advanced notice if issues arise. If you have a car, please let us know as this will help coordinate rides for other promoters.
4. 🗨️ **Communication Skills**: Strong communication skills and the ability to engage with potential patrons are vital.
5. 🎊 **Event Knowledge**: A good understanding of the specific event you are promoting, as well as our brand and values.
6. 👗 **Appearance**: Promoters should present themselves in a clean, presentable, and fashion-forward manner.

## Rules:

1. ☮️ **P.L.U.R. Principle**: Embrace Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect. Avoid starting drama, fights, or making negative comments especially about our events, venues, team, or artists.
2. ❌ **No Drug Sales**: Do not sell drugs.
3. 🚫 **Exclusivity**: Do not promote other events, work other events simultaneously, or promote events the same weekend as ours.

**Note**: Please discreetly let us know if your fellow promoters are in breach of these rules, but if you snitch on them for just a minor offense it reflects poorly on you and is likely to annoy your supervisor who probably doesn't want to waste their time analyzing the drama at all.


## Promoter Statuses:

👥 **Active**: Promoters consistently meet or exceed all requirements for either their entire work term or the past 3 months (whichever is applicable). Active promoters are eligible for all benefits and may qualify for additional incentives if they consistently exceed minimum requirements.

🔇 **Inactive**: Promoters who do not meet requirements or have broken the rules are considered inactive. Inactive promoters may still be eligible for limited benefits at the discretion of the promotions manager.

🚫 **Terminated**: Promoters who fail to meet requirements for at least two consecutive weeks or four total weeks or serverly violate rules are subject to termination. The severity of an offense is determined solely by the promotions manager.

## Next Steps:

👣 Please review this document carefully and ensure that you are prepared for your onboarding session. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to contact the promotions manager. We're excited to have you on board as a rave promoter and look forward to your contributions to our events. Let's work together to create unforgettable nights for our fellow ravers!
