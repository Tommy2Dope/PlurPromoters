3. 🚫 **Exclusivity**: Do not promote other events, work other events simultaneously, or promote events the same weekend as ours.

**Note**: Please discreetly let us know if your fellow promoters are in breach of these rules, but if you snitch on them for just a minor offense it reflects poorly on you and is likely to annoy your supervisor who probably doesn't want to waste their time analyzing the drama at all.


## Promoter Statuses:

👥 **Active**: Promoters consistently meet or exceed all requirements for either the work term or the past 3 months (whichever is applicable). Active promoters are eligible for all benefits and may qualify for additional incentives if they consistently exceed minimum requirements.

🔇 **Inactive**: Promoters who do not meet requirements or have minor rule breaches are considered inactive. Inactive promoters may still be eligible for limited benefits at the discretion of the promotions manager.

🚫 **Terminated**: Promoters who fail to meet requirements for at least two consecutive weeks or four total weeks or violate rules severely are subject to termination. The severity of the offense is determined solely by the promotions manager.

## Next Steps:

👣 Please review this document carefully and ensure that you are prepared for your onboarding session. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to contact the promotions manager. We're excited to have you on board as a rave promoter and look forward to your contributions to our events. Let's work together to create unforgettable nights for our fellow ravers!
